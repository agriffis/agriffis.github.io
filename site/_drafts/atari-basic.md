When I was young, Dad was the headmaster of the elementary school I attended,
and Mom was the school's bookkeeper. The school owned a few
[Atari 800 computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family), both
for office and classroom use, and we often took one home for Mom and Dad to do
their word processing and spreadsheets.

I wasn't interested in those programs, but the computer also included a
BASIC cartridge and
[manual](https://archive.org/details/atari-basic-reference-manual), and I
*loved* those.

$$y = \sum_{\alpha = 0}^{x}(11 - \alpha)$$
