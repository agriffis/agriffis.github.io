Did you know that Bash scripts run sequentially from disk?<a href="#foot1" id="ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

This means that if the script changes on disk during execution, Bash will
blindly resume at the current offset. Depending on how the script changed, that
can be disastrous.

Here's a contrived example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo hi
sleep 20
#rm -rf *
```

If this script is updated on disk during that twenty second pause, then Bash
will run whatever it finds at byte offset 30, previously the commented line `#rm
-rf *`.

Let's say you decide the sleep should be shorter, so you tweak it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo hi
sleep 5
#rm -rf *
```

If the script was in the midst of its 20-second pause when you wrote this to
disk, Bash would execute the `rm -rf *` because the removal of a digit from the
sleep causes the byte offset 30 to skip over the comment character. Yikes!

Now that your imagination is running scared, here's one way to fix it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

main() {
  echo hi
  sleep 20
  echo there

  # Explicit exit to avoid execution continuing dangerously at byte offset.
  # See https://arongriffis.com/2023-11-18-bash-main
  exit
}

main "$@"
```

This works because Bash loads the function into memory before running it, and
the function exits instead of returning.

As a pleasant side effect, this structure lets you define your other functions
after `main`, so that you can jump directly into the main flow in your editor:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

main() {
  build && test && install

  # Explicit exit to avoid execution continuing dangerously at byte offset.
  # See https://arongriffis.com/2023-11-18-bash-main
  exit
}

build() {
  run the compiler or something
}

test() {
  because you always write tests
}

install() {
  life is good
}

main "$@"
```

Seriously, though, have you considered Python?

<a href="#ref1" id="foot1">[1]</a> Technically, the granularity is compound
command or line, whichever is larger. For example, `while true; do ... done` is
read as a unit from disk, even if it spans multiple lines, and `echo hi; echo
hello` is read as a unit from disk even though it is multiple commands, because
they're on the same line.
