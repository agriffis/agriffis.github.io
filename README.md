# arongriffis.com (astro edition)

This is the nth iteration of [my personal website and blog](https://arongriffis.com), this time using [Astro](https://astro.build/)

Previously [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Switched to Astro because this site shouldn't need an application server.

I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) before Next.js, so in some ways it's come full circle back to static site generation, but Astro is much more capable than Jekyll.
